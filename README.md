We aim to revolutionize entrepreneurship by introducing a cutting-edge ideation helper powered by AI technology that suggests new ideas based on pre-existing user-inputted brainstorming lists.
This tool will utilize a three-tier architecture, including web development tools such as React/TypeScript and Flask for a user-friendly interface - as well as tools such as Scrapy, GPT-3 API, and AutoGPT to do efficient market analysis - to identify current gaps in the market and potential customer interest, enhanced by storage and searching capabilities. With this tool, users will be able to learn the best potential businesses they can start; this tool will also provide a step-by-step guide and modern user interface for novice entrepreneurs, empowering the future of business for all.
