# Team Report
## Goals from the Previous Week
* Create a basic crawler and connect it to AutoGPT technology (within the next three days)
* Experiment with at least 3 different NLP models for text-generation (within the next three days) and choose the ones which most closely fit and are most successful with our use cases (within the three days after that). 
* Implement intended UI design into the website with limited functionality. Using a template or from scratch, create a modern looking UI (within the next three days). 
* Create backend endpoints for ideation generation, and other required components (within the next three days). 
* Create required tables in database with indexing. Have the ability to run queries from backend (within the next three days). 

## Progress and Issues
* We created backend endpoints for ideation generation and created a modern looking UI.
* We researched more into AutoGPT and began the first steps of implementing it into our model
* We struggled with being able to connect the AutoGPT with the backend due to installation issues, and plan to have this resolved soon. We will discuss our overall progress and what steps should be next with our project manager.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week
* Choose a NLP model that properly fits our project for text-generation, and begin to experiment with prompts that users will choose (within the next three days).

# Contributions of Individual Team Members.
## Goals from the Previous Week
* Alon - By the end of next week, I will set up a demo backend and connect it to a mock html/js/css frontend.
* Jacob - I will publish our web app, create required database tables with indexing, and write optimized SQL queries which will be given to those in charge of Flask backend.
* Bhavya - I will begin designing our web application using the appropriate web dev and have it connect to the backend 
* Tim - This week I want to have a functioning web application with Flask that has a skeleton with all of the APIs we will be using in our project.
* Julia - Within the three days after our Flask is fully functional, I will have made progress with implementing basic AutoGPT throughout our project. My ultimate goal for the end of the quarter is to fully incorporate our site with AutoGPT capabilities to make for an effective product.

## Progress and Issues
* Alon - 
* Jacob - 
* Bhavya - 
* Tim -  
* Julia - I started to connect AutoGPT with our backend and researched into how to use AutoGPT. I struggled with installation errors and being able to connect AutoGPT, since this is a new skill for me, but I plan on having this resolved soon.


## Plans and Goals for Next Week
* Alon - 
* Jacob - 
* Bhavya - 
* Tim -  
* Julia - By the next three days I will have fully connected AutoGPT with our backend and will experiment with different models and optimizations.
