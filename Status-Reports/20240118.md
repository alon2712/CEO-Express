# Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).
* We worked on creating a requirements document that included all features and considerations for our project.
* We learned about how to define the scope of our project and how to be specific and intentive with what features we want to include.
* We had trouble with generating ideas for the use cases and implementing all the exact steps and elements of the use cases.
* So far, we do not have any blocks since we will ask our TA for further guidance.

The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress. If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.



# Contributions of individual team members.

The second subsection reports on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

For the team report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.
